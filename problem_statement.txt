1. Write a Kyverno policy that limits the amount of containers that can be in a single Pod.
The policy should check all pods to ensure that they have no more than two containers. 
You should show a case where a resource is blocked due to policy violation and another 
case where a resource is successfully created.

2. Use the policy you created in the 1st step to write a Kyverno policy exception that grants an 
exception to a Pod or Deployment named important-app which will be created in the delta namespace.
You should show a case where a resource is successfully created although it violates the policy.


You should provide a link to a github repository that have all the policies and resources you created. 
You can document the work done in a README.md
